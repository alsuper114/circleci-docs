# CircleCI Documentation

This is a public repository of CircleCI documentation. Contributions welcome!

CircleCI Documentation is a static website generated by 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you find any errors or have documentation 
request, please feel free to contribute by following the instructions below. 
Otherwise, you can always open an 
[Issue](https://github.com/circleci/circleci-docs/issues) on this project.

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get going is to use Vagrant. To get a local copy of 
circleci.com/docs/ up and running you can run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/circleci/circleci-docs.git
cd circleci-docs
./jctl start
```

Jekyll will automatically start in the VM and can be viewed in your browser at 
http://localhost:4040/docs/

### Prerequisites

If you're going the Vagrant route, the following software need to be installed:

- Git - system version should be fine
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) - 
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) - best to use version 5.0+. Another Vagrant Provider such as Docker could be used instead but VirtualBox is default.

### First Run

The first time you run `./jctl start`, Vagrant will provision the entire VM for 
you based on what's in `bootstrap.sh`. It'll then run Jekyll for you. The whole 
process can take a few minutes but it's a one time deal.

Once this is complete, Vagrant starts forwarding port 4040 for you. You can 
simply view the docs at http://localhost:4040/docs/ .

###  Editing Docs

All of the docs can be found in the `_docs` directory. You can make any changes 
that you need there then run `./jctl rebuild` to have Jekyll rebuild the site. 
How to use **jctl** can be found below. You could also run `vagrant ssh` and 
enter the VM directly. By default, the repo will be at `/vagrant`. From there 
you could run `jekyll server` with whatever flags you would like.

## Jekyll Controller (JTCL)

This is a Bash wrapper script to talk to Jekyll & Vagrant.

- start: Starts Jekyll. Is Vagrant isn't running, starts Vagrant as well.
- rebuild: Tells Jekyll to rebuild the site.
- stop: Shuts down the entire VM (vagrant halt), including Jekyll.
- restart: Restarts the Vagrant machine. Basically an alias of stop then start.
