# CircleCI API Reference Guide

## API Overview

The CircleCI API is a full-featured RESTful API that allows you to access all information and trigger all actions in CircleCI. RESTful APIs enable you to call individual API endpoints to perform the following actions:

* GET - retrieve specific information, which may include arrays and sets of data and information.
* POST - create/add a new API element.
* PUT - update an existing API element in the API server.
* DELETE - remove/delete an API element in the API server.

<aside class="notice">
Although RESTful APIs include these 4 HTTP verbs, the CircleCI API does not currently use the `PUT` verb.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
Access to billing functions is only available from the CircleCI application.
</aside>

### API Syntax

When making an API request, make sure you follow standard REST API syntax and formatting. Adhering to proper REST API syntax ensures that the API server can properly process your request and return a JSON response. To make a request to the CircleCI API, use the format shown in the pane to the right:
"https://circleci.com/api/v1.1"

Where:

* https://circleci.com - the resource URL for the API being called.
* api - the class being called.
* v1.1 - the API version.

### Authentication

The CircleCI API utilizes token-based authentication to manage access to the API server and validate that a user has permission to make API requests. Before you can make an API request, you must first add an API token and then verify that you are authenticated by the API server to make requests. The process to add an API token and have the API server authenticate you is described in the sections below.

#### Add an API Token

```
$ curl https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/me?circle-token=:token
```

To add an API token, perform the steps listed below.

```
{
  "user_key_fingerprint" : null,
  "days_left_in_trial" : -238,
  "plan" : "p16",
  "trial_end" : "2011-12-28T22:02:15Z",
  "basic_email_prefs" : "smart",
  "admin" : true,
  "login" : "pbiggar"
 }
```

1.  Add an API token from your [account dashboard](https://circleci.com/account/api).
2.  To test it, [View it in your browser](https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/me) or call the API using
3.  You should see a response similar to the example shown in the right pane.

<aside class="notice">
All API calls are made in the same way, by making standard HTTP calls, using JSON, a content-type, and your API token.
</aside>

#### Get Authenticated

```
curl https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/me?circle-token=:token
```

```
curl -u <circle-token>: https://circleci.com/api/...
```

To be authenticated by the API server, add an API token using your [account dashboard](https://circleci.com/account/api). To use the API token, add it to the `circle-token` query param:

Alternatively, you can use the API token as the username for HTTP Basic Authentication, by passing the `-u` flag to the `curl` command:

<aside class="notice">
the colon ":" tells curl that there's no password.
</aside>

### Version Control Systems (:vcs-type)

```
curl https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/:vcs-type/:username/:project/tree/:branch
```

New with v1.1 of the API, for endpoints under /project you will now need to tell CircleCI what version control system type your project uses. You may currently select either ‘github’ or ‘bitbucket’. The command for recent builds for a project would be formatted like the example shown in the right pane.

### F/OSS

If you have a [Free / Open Source Software (F/OSS) project] (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), and have the setting turned on in Advanced Settings in your project dashboard, some read-only /project endpoints will return the requested data without the need for a token. People will also be able to view the build results dashboard for the project as well.

### List Ordering

There are two API endpoints where the list order is significant:

* Recent Builds Across All Projects 
* Recent Builds For a Single Project 

In both cases, builds are returned in the order that they were created. For all other endpoints, the order has no special significance.

### Accept Header

```
curl https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/me?circle-token=:token -H "Accept: application/json"
```

If no accept header is specified, CircleCI will return human-readable JSON with comments. If you prefer to receive compact JSON with no whitespace or comments, add the `application/json` Accept header.

## Getting Started

CircleCI 1.0 and 2.0 are supported by API version 1.1 as documented in the following sections:

* Summary of API Endpoints
* User
* Projects
* Test Metadata
* SSH Keys
* Heroku Keys

## Summary of API Endpoints

All CircleCI API endpoints begin with `https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/`

## Artifacts Of A Build

Returns an array of artifacts produced by a given build.

### Method

GET

### Example Call

You can download an individual artifact file via the API by appending a query string to its URL. Note that `:token` is an API token with 'view-builds' scope.

## Artifacts of the latest Build

Returns an array of artifacts produced by the latest build on a given branch.

**Parameter** | **Description**
------- | -------------
branch | The branch you would like to look in for the latest build. Returns artifacts for latest build in entire project if omitted.
filter | Restricts which builds are returned. Set to "completed", "successful", "failed", "running", or defaults to no filter.

### Method

GET

} ]
```

### Notes

* the value of path is relative to the project root (the working_directory)

https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/:vcs-type/:username/:project/:build_num/ssh

You can retry a build with ssh by swapping “retry” with “ssh”.

## Add User to Build

This API call is only available when using a user API token. If the current user has permission to build the project, this API adds the current user's SSH public key to the authorized keys on each container running a build. This allows them to SSH to the build containers.

### Method

POST

### Example Call

```
curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/:vcs-type/:username/:project/:build_num/ssh-users?circle-token=:token
```

### Example Response

```
{... the build data ... }
```

## Cancel a Build

Cancels the build and then returns a summary of the build.

### Method

POST

### Example Call

```
curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/:vcs-type/:username/:project/:build_num/cancel?circle-token=:token
```
