This document describes
how to use CircleCI
using a sample application written in Python.

## Overview

This guide uses a [sample Django application](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-python-django)
to describe configuration best practices
for Python applications building on CircleCI.
Consider [forking this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
and rewriting the configuration file
while following this guide.

## Configuration Walkthrough

Every CircleCI project requires a configuration file
located in `.circleci/config.yml`.
Follow the steps below
to build a `config.yml` from scratch.

### Specify Version

Every `config.yml` starts with the [`version`]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/#version) key.
This key is used
to issue warnings about breaking changes or deprecations.

```yaml
version: 2  # use CircleCI 2.0
```

## Pre-Built CircleCI Docker Images

We recommend using a CircleCI pre-built image that comes pre-installed with tools that are useful in a CI environment. You can select the Python version you need from Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/python/>. The demo project uses an official CircleCI image.

Database images for use as a secondary 'service' container are also available on Docker Hub in the `circleci` directory.

### Specify a Python version (pick a Docker image)

### Add additional services (databases, etc.)

### Install package managers and dependencies

### Set up caching rules for dependencies

### Run test suites

### Deploy the application

First, specify a `jobs` key. Each job represents a phase in your Build-Test-Deploy (BTD) process. The sample app only needs a `build` job, so all other configuration will be nested under that key.

Specify a working directory and container images for this build in `docker` section:

```yaml
...
jobs: # a collection of steps
  build: # runs not using Workflows must have a `build` job as entry point
    working_directory: ~/circleci-demo-python-django # directory where steps will run
    docker: # run the steps with Docker
      - image: circleci/python:3.6.1 # ...with this image as the primary container; this is where all `steps` will run
      - image: circleci/postgres:9.6.2 # database image for service container available at `localhost:<port>`
        environment: # environment variables for database
          POSTGRES_USER: root
          POSTGRES_DB: circle_test
```

Finally, add several `steps` within the `build` job:

{% raw %}

```yaml
    steps: # a collection of executable commands
      - checkout # special step to check out source code to the working directory
      - restore_cache: # restores saved dependency cache if the Branch key template or requirements.txt files have not changed since the previous run
          key: deps1-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "requirements.txt" }}
      - run: # install and activate virtual environment with pip
          command: |
            python3 -m venv venv
            . venv/bin/activate
            pip install -r requirements.txt
      - save_cache: # special step to save dependency cache
          key: deps1-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "requirements.txt" }}
          paths:
            - "venv"
      - run: # run tests
          command: |
            . venv/bin/activate
            python manage.py test
      - store_artifacts: # special step to store test reports as artifacts
          path: test-reports/
          destination: tr1
      # See https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/deployment-integrations/ for deploy examples    
```

{% endraw %}
