# API Overview

The CircleCI platform provides a powerful API that enables users to retrieve detailed information about users, jobs, workflows and pipelines.

## API Classes

The current classes of the API v2 endpoints are:

- Authentication
- Pipeline
- Workflows
- User (Preview)
- Project (Preview)
- Job (Preview)

**Note:** Portions of the CircleCI API v2 remain under “Preview”. Preview endpoints are not yet fully supported or considered generally available. Breaking changes to API v2 Preview endpoints are planned in advance and are announced in the API v2 breaking changes log.

## Authentication and Authorization

The CircleCI API utilizes token-based authentication to manage access to the API server and validate that a user has permission to make API requests. Before you can make an API request, you must first add an API token and then verify that you are authenticated by the API server to make requests. The process to add an API token and have the API server authenticate you is described in the sections below.

**Note** You may use the API token as the username for HTTP Basic Authentication, by passing the `-u` flag to the `curl` command.

### Add an API Token

To add an API token, perform the steps listed below.

1.  Add an API token from your [account dashboard](https://circleci.com/account/api).
2.  To test it, [view it in your browser](https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/me) or call the API using the command below.

```sh
$ curl https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/me?circle-token=:token
```

**Note:** Whenever you see a term prefixed with a colon (:), please note that this value must be replaced by a user-input value. For example `:token` in the above call must be replaced by the token string generated in your account:

`curl https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/me?circle-token=dkanmbowk34iajdkl3iakdthisisarandomtoken`

3.  You should see a JSON response similar to the example shown below.

```json
{
  "user_key_fingerprint" : null,
  "days_left_in_trial" : -238,
  "plan" : "p16",
  "trial_end" : "2011-12-28T22:02:15Z",
  "basic_email_prefs" : "smart",
  "admin" : true,
  "login" : "someuser"
 }
```

**Note:** All API calls are made in the same way, by making standard HTTP calls, using JSON, a content-type, and your API token. Please note that the JSON examples shown in this document are not comprehensive and may contain additional JSON response fields not shown in the example, based on user input and fields.

### Get Authenticated

To be authenticated by the API server, add an API token using your [account dashboard](https://circleci.com/account/api). To use the API token, add it to the `circle-token` query param:

```sh
curl "https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/me?circle-token=:token"
```

Alternatively, you can use the API token as the username for HTTP Basic Authentication, by passing the `-u` flag to the `curl` command:

```sh 
curl -u <circle-token>: "https://circleci.com/api/..."
```

**Note:** The colon ":" notifies `curl` that there is no password being passed.

## API Endpoints

The CircleCI v2 API, and its associated endpoints allow you to make HTTP calls to designated endpoints developed in the underlying CircleCI API architecture. These endpoints provide programmatic access to CircleCI services, including pipelines, workflows, and jobs. 

Before working with the API and making calls, you should first have an understanding of the endpoints that are currently available, as detailed in the table below:

Endpoint       | Description                       
-----------|-------------------------------------------------------
`GET /workflow/:id ` | This endpoint enables users to return an individual Workflow based on the `id` parameter being passed in the request
`GET /workflow/:id/jobs` | This endoint enables users to retrieve all Jobs associated with a specific workflow, based on its unique `id`.
`GET /project/:project_slug`  | This endpoint enables users to retrieve a specific Project by its unique slug.
`POST /project/:project_slug/pipeline` | This endpoint enables users to add an individual project by its unique slug.
`GET /pipeline/:id` | This endpoint enables users to retrieve an individual pipeline, based on the `id` passed in the request.
`GET /pipeline/:id/config`  | This endpoint enables users to retrieve the configuration of a specific pipeline, based on the `id` passed in the request.
`GET /project/:project_slug/pipelines/[:filter]`  | This endpoint enables users to retrieve the most recent set of pipelines for a Project.

## API Syntax

When making an API request, make sure you follow standard REST API syntax and formatting. Adhering to proper REST API syntax ensures the API server can properly process your request and return a valid JSON response. To make a request to the CircleCI API, use the following format:

`https://circleci.com/api/v2`

Where:

- `https://circleci.com` is the resource URL for the API being called.
- `api` is the service being called.
- `v2` is the API version.

# Getting Started with the API

The CircleCI API v2 is backwards-compatible with previous API versions in the way it identifies your projects using repository name. For instance, if you want to pull information from CircleCI about the GitHub repository https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli you can refer to that in the CircleCI API as `gh/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli`, which is a “triplet” of the project type, the name of your “organization”, and the name of the repository. For the project type you can use `github` or `bitbucket` as well as the shorter forms `gh` or `bb`, which are supported in API v2. The `organization` is your username or organization name in your version control system.

With API v2, CircleCI is introducing a string representation of the triplet called the `project_slug`, which takes the following form:

`<project_type>/<org_name>/<repo_name>`

The `project_slug` is included in the payload when pulling information about a project as well as when looking up a pipeline or workflow by ID. The `project_slug` can then be used to get information about the project. It is possible in the future the shape of a `project_slug` may change, but in all cases it would be usable as a human-readable identifier for a given project.

# HTTP Status Codes and Response Handling

When you make an API request to the server, an HTTP status code is returned along with the JSON body response. The CircleCI API v2 adheres to standard HTTP response codes, which include the following status code definitions:

200 - Success
400 - Client error
500 - Server error

## 200 Status Codes

If you receive a 200 HTTP status code, your API request is successful and the requested resource will be returned. The following 200 HTTP status codes could potentially be returned with your request:

`200 - OK`

## 400 Status Codes

If you receive a 400 HTTP status code, there is a problem with the request and the server is unable to successfully process the request. The following status codes may be returned with your request:

`401 - Unauthorized`
`403 - Forbidden`
`404 - Not Found`

## 500 Status Code

If you receive a 500 HTTP status code, there is a problem with the server and the request cannot be processed. If you encounter a 500 response, the error will be logged and CircleCI will work to resolve the error. The following 500 HTTP status codes could potentially be returned with your request:

`500 - Internal Server Error`

# REST API Tutorial

For more detailed information about HTTP status codes, refer to the [rest api tutorial](http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html).

# Example End-to-End API Request

The following section details the steps you would need, from start to finish, to make an API call. This section includes creating a "demo repository" called "hello-world", however, you can use a pre-existing repository to follow along if you choose.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub or BitBucket account with a repository to setup with CircleCI.
- Completion of the CircleCI onboarding.
- **Optional**: You can format JSON responses by piping the `curl` command into the `jq` utility if you have it installed: `curl ... | jq`.

## Steps

1. On your VCS provider, create a repository. The repo for this example will be called `hello-world`.

2. Next, follow the onboarding for a new project on CircleCI. You can access onboarding by visiting the application and clicking on "Add Projects" in the sidebar or by going to the link: https://onboarding.circleci.com/project-dashboard/{VCS}/{ORG_NAME} where `VCS` is either `github` (or `gh`) or `bitbucket` (or `bb`) and `ORG_NAME` is your organization or personal VCS username. Find your project in the onboarding list and click `Setup Project`. After completing an onboarding, you should have a valid `config.yml` file in a `.circleci` folder at the root of your repository. In this example, the `config.yml` contains the following:

    ```sh
    # Use the latest 2.1 version of CircleCI pipeline process engine. See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference
    version: 2.1
    # Use a package of configuration called an orb.
    orbs:
      # Declare a dependency on the welcome-orb
      welcome: circleci/welcome-orb@0.4.1
    # Orchestrate or schedule a set of jobs
    workflows:
      # Name the workflow "welcome"
      welcome:
        # Run the welcome/run job in its own container
        jobs:
          - welcome/run
    ```

3. Add an API token from your [account dashboard](https://circleci.com/account/api). Be sure to write down and store your API token in a secure place once you generate it.

4. It's time to test our your API token using `curl` to make sure everything works. The following code snippets demonstrate querying all pipelines on a project. Please note the example below, the values within curly braces (`{}`) need to be replaced with values specific to your username/orgname.

    ```sh
    # First: set your CircleCI token as an environment variable
    export CIRCLECI_TOKEN={your_api_token}
    
    curl --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLECI_TOKEN" \
         --header 'Accept: application/json'    \
         --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/gh/{USER_NAME}/hello-world/pipeline 
    ```

    You will likely receive a long string of unformatted JSON. After formatting, it should look like so:

    ```sh
    {
      "next_page_token": null,
      "items": [
        {
          "id": "03fcbba0-d847-4c8b-a553-6fdd7854b893",
          "errors": [],
          "project_slug": "gh/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/hello-world",
          "updated_at": "2020-01-10T19:45:58.517Z",
          "number": 1,
          "state": "created",
          "created_at": "2020-01-10T19:45:58.517Z",
          "trigger": {
            "received_at": "2020-01-10T19:45:58.489Z",
            "type": "api",
            "actor": {
              "login": "teesloane",
              "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12987958?v=4"
            }
          },
          "vcs": {
            "origin_repository_url": "https://github.com/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/hello-world",
            "target_repository_url": "https://github.com/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/hello-world",
            "revision": "ca67134f650e362133e51a9ffdb8e5ddc7fa53a5",
            "provider_name": "GitHub",
            "branch": "master"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
That's great! Hopefully everything is working for you up to this point. Let's move on to performing something that might be a bit more useful.

5. One of the benefits of the CircleCI API v2 is the ability to remotely trigger pipelines with parameters. The following code snippet simply triggers a pipeline via `curl` without any body parameters:

    ```sh
    curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/gh/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/hello-world/pipeline \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -H "Circle-Token: $CIRCLECI_TOKEN" \
      
    # Which returns:
    {
      "number": 2,
      "state": "pending",
      "id": "e411ea74-c64a-4d60-9292-115e782802ed",
      "created_at": "2020-01-15T15:32:36.605Z"
    }
    ```

While this alone can be useful, we want to be able to customize parameters of the pipeline when we send this POST request. By including a body parameter in the `curl` request (via the `-d` flag), we can customize specific attributes of the pipeline when it runs: pipeline parameters, the branch, or the git tag. Below, we are telling the pipelines to trigger for "my-branch"

    ```sh
    curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/gh/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/hello-world/pipeline \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -H "Circle-Token: $CIRCLECI_TOKEN" \
      -H 'x-attribution-login: string' \
      -H 'x-attribution-actor-id: string' 
      -d "branch=my-branch"
    ```

6. Let's move on to a more complex example: triggering a pipeline and passing a parameter that can be dynamically substituted into your configuration. In this example, we will pass a docker image tag to our docker-executor key. First, we will need to modify the `.circleci/config.yml` to be a little more complex than the standard "Hello World" sample provided by the onboarding.

    ```yaml
    version: 2.1
    parameters:
      image-tag:
        type: string
        default: "latest"
    
    jobs:
      build:
        docker:
          - image: circleci/node:<< pipeline.parameters.image-tag >>
        environment:
          IMAGETAG: << pipeline.parameters.image-tag >>
        steps:
          - run: echo "Image tag used was ${IMAGETAG}"
    ```

You will need to declare the parameters you expect to receive from the API. In this case, under the `parameters` key, we definte an "image-tag" to be expected in the JSON payload of a POST request to the _Trigger New Pipeline_ endpoint.

7. Now we can run a `curl` request that passes variables in a POST request, similar to the following:

    ```sh
    curl -u ${CIRCLECI_TOKEN}: -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
      "parameters": {
        "image-tag": "4.8.2"
      }
    }' https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/gh/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/hello-world/pipeline
    ```

This concludes the end-to-end example of using the V2 API. For more detailed information about other endpoints you may wish to call, please refer to the [CircleCI API v2 Documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/api/v2/#circleci-api) for an overview of all endpoints currently available.

# API Use Cases

Now that you have a general understanding of how the CircleCI API v2 service works through an end-to-end API example request and walkthrough, let's look at a few common tasks and operations you may perform when using the API. Whether you wish to return information about a job or project, or retrieve more detailed information about a project by reviewing its artifacts, the examples shown below should assist you in gaining a better understanding of how to make some API requests to the server so you can perform a deep dive into the specifics of your work.

This section provides detailed information on how you can perform the following tasks and operations:

* Retrieving detailed information about a Job
* Retrieving detailed informaiton about a Project
* Download artifacts

## Get Job Details

The following section details the steps you need to perform to retrieve detailed information about a job using a GET API call. Returning details about a specific job can be very helpful in better understanding job performance and what changes, if any, you may wish to make to ensure even better job performance in your future tests.

### Prerequisites

Before making an API call, make sure you have met the following prerequisites:

* You have set up a GitHub or BitBucket account with a repository to use with CircleCI.
* You have completed CircleCI onboarding and you have a project setup.
* You have a personal API token.
* You have been authenticated to make API calls to the server.

### Steps

Of the several Jobs-related API endpoints available with CircleCI API v2, there is a specific endpoint you may wish to call to receive detailed information about your job. This API call, `GET /project/{project-slug}/job/{job-number}`, enables you to return information about a specific job by passing the `project-slug` and `job-number` parameters with your request.

**Note** In this example, please note that whenever you see curly brackets `{}`, this represents a variable that you must manually enter in the request.

To return job details, perform the following steps:

1. Declare the parameters you expect to receive from the API. For this GET API call, under the `parameters` key, define the `project slug` and `job number` parameters you want returned in the JSON payload in your `curl` request as follows:

```sh
curl -X GET https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project-slug}/job/{job-number} \ 
-H 'Accept: application/json'
```
Where:

GET - the HTTP request being made
https://circleci.com
api - 
v2 - API version
project - the API class being called in the request
{project-slug} - 
job - 
{job-number} - user-generated




## Download Artifacts

The following section details the steps you need to follow to download artifacts generated when a job is run. We will go through the steps of returning a list of artifacts for a job, and then changing the command we run to download the full set of artifacts. If you are looking for instructions to download the latest artifacts for a pipeline, without needing to specify a job number, see our [API v1.1 guide](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/#downloading-all-artifacts-for-a-build-on-circleci) – keep checking back here as this functionality will be added to API v2 in the future.

### Prerequisites

Before making an API call, make sure you have met the following prerequisites:

* You have set up a GitHub or BitBucket account with a repository to use with CircleCI.
* You have completed CircleCI onboarding and you have a project setup.
* You have a [personal API token](https://circleci.com/account/api).
* You have been [authenticated](#get-authenticated) to make API calls to the server.

### Steps

1. First we will ensure your api token is set as an environment variable. You maybe have already done this during authentication, but if not, run the following command in your terminal, substituting your personal api token:

    ```
    export CIRCLECI_TOKEN={your_api_token}
    ```

2.  Next we need the job number for the job you want to get artifacts for. You can find job numbers in the UI - either in the breadcrumbs on the Job Details page, or in the URL.

    INSERT SCREENSHOT HIGHLIGHTING JOB NUMBER

3.  Next we can use `curl` to return a list of artifacts for a specific job. Note, you can format JSON responses by piping the `curl` command into the `jq` utility if you have it installed: `curl ... | jq`:

    ```sh
    curl -X GET https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{VCS}/{org-name}/{repo-name}/{job-number}/artifacts \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H "Circle-Token: $CIRCLECI_TOKEN" | jq\
    ```

    Check the table below for help with formatting your API call correctly

    Parameter | Description
    --- | ---
    `VCS` | Version Control System - either `github`/`gh` or `bitbucket`/`bb`
    `org-name` | Organization name, or your personal username to your VCS
    `repo-name` | Name of your project repo
    `job-number` | The number for the job you want to download artifacts from - see step 2
    
    <BR>
    You should get a list of artifacts back - if the job you chose has artifacts associated with it. Here's and extract from the outut when requesting artifacts for a job that builds these docs:

    ```
    {
      "path": "circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough6.png",
      "node_index": 0,
      "url": "https://53936-48750547-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough6.png"
    },
    {
      "path": "circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough7.png",
      "node_index": 0,
      "url": "https://53936-48750547-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough7.png"
    },
    {
      "path": "circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough8.png",
      "node_index": 0,
      "url": "https://53936-48750547-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough8.png"
    },
    ```

    CHECK ITS OK TO INCLUDE THIS

4. Next we can add to this API call to download the artifacts into our current location.
