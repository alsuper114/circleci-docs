== Service Configuration Overrides
This section describes the configuration interface for overriding services in CircleCI Server.

WARNING: Customizing your configuration can have potentially damaging consequences, so we recommend contacting support@circleci.com for guidance before making any changes.

Configuration is done by exporting environment variables in files located on the Services machine.

Consider the file “customizations” created at the following path /etc/circleconfig/workflows-conductor:

```shell
export FOO="bar"
```

The value of FOO will take precedence over the default values set in the default container mapping in the CircleCI Server configuration.

=== Available Overrides
