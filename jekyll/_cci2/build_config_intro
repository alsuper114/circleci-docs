The CircleCI Build Configuration Cookbook is a collection of individual use cases (referred to as "recipes") that provide you with detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to perform various build configuration tasks using CircleCI resources (including CircleCI and partner-certified Orbs). This guide, and its associated pages, will enable you to quickly and easily perform repeatable build tasks on the CircleCI platform.

## Introduction

This page, and its associated "recipes" on subsequent pages, describes how you can perform specific tasks using a set of steps and instructions, including code snippets and examples, to ensure your CircleCI build is properly configured. Each "recipe" in this "cookbook" relates to a single task that you can perform on the CircleCI platform using your own resources in addition to CircleCI resources. In order to maximize efficiency and speed, you may wish to earmark build configuration tasks
