This document provides a summary of features and product notes for the release of CircleCI Server v{serverversion}. For a full list of changes, including patch releases, refer to the https://circleci.com/server/changelog[changelog]. For a step by step guide to **upgrading** your CircleCI Server installation to v{serverversion}, see our <<updating-server#,upgrade guide>>.

## Requirements for Upgrading

WARNING: For AWS installs, *before upgrading* to v2.19, follow <<update-nomad-clients-2190#,this guide>> to update your nomad launch configuration.

CAUTION: If at any time your organization name has been changed, there is a <<updating-server#org-rename-script,script>> that *must* be run before stating the upgrade process. If you are already running v2.18.x, you will have run this already.

## Notes and Best Practices

* We now require a minimum 32GB of RAM for the Services Machine. 
* We have made some changes to our Redis configuration. If you have externalized Redis then youâ€™ll need to update your configuration. Please contact your Customer Success Manager.
* We have also made changes to our Postgres version and require at least postgreSQL v9.5.16. If you have externalized postgreSQL then please update to at least that version in 2.17.x before upgrading to 2.18.

## What's New in Release 2.19

ADD IN ONCE CHANGELOG IS READY

## Known Issues

* The first user to access a CircleCI Server installation should be granted admin access. Currently, there is an issue preventing this from happening when LDAP authentication is in use. Follow <<authentication#grant-admin-access-to-user,this guide>> for a workaround.
