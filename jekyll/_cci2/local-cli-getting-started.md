# Overview

For those who prefer to spend most of their development time in the terminal,
consider installing the CircleCI CLI to interact with your CircleCI projects and
other components of the web application.

This document provides a getting started guide to the local CLI. If you are new
to the CircleCI platform, you may want to consider reading our [getting
started]() guide or reading our [getting started concepts
document](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/concepts/#section=getting-started)
before installing the CLI.
