Deployment at CircleCI is just the same as any other job configuration; you can create a deployment job and configure it to deploy to virtually any target. This document provides an overview of the deployment process, along with best practices and optimization strategies.

== Overview

Once a software application has been developed and tested, it needs to be deployed and made available for its intended audience. CircleCI can be configured to deploy to any target, and can be easily configured to integrate with other services for QA/testing, feature management, deployment strategies such as blue-green or canary deployment. Quickly and easily customize your config to match your deployment strategy, whether a fully automated process or elements of manual approval are required.

== Deployment: The Basics

* **Deployment Job**: To deploy your application, add a <<job-steps#jobs-overview,job>> to your `.circleci/config.yml` file and configure the job to run the steps required to deploy your application.

* **Deployment Parameters**: To fulfill the deploy steps you will need to [add environment variables]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project) and/or [SSH keys]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/add-ssh-key/) for your specific deployment target. These can be added to the project itself, or defined within your configuration.
** For an example of defining environment variables within your configuration see the non-orbs example above, within the deploy job configuration we have:
+
```
environment:
      HEROKU_APP: "sleepy-refuge-55486"
```
+
Alternatively, the `HEROKU_APP` environment variable could be defined within you project, via the **Project Settings** page in the UI.

* **Manual Approval**: If your deployment strategy requires a manual approval step, you can include a <<configuration-reference#type,hold/approve>> job within your workflow. A manual approval button will then be available from the workflows map in the CircleCI UI.

=== Using Orbs to Simplify Deploys

https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/[Orbs] are available for many common deployment targets to help simplify and streamline your config â€“ check out the full range of available orbs in the https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/[Orbs Registry]. Orbs are packages of reusable configuration, and often, for simple pipelines, simply invoking an orb, including a pre-configured job, and setting any requires environment variables/SSH keys within your project, will get you the results you need with no further configuration. 

As an example, consider the https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/aws-code-deploy[AWS CodeDeploy orb]. This orb has a pre-configured `deploy` job, which you can include in your configuration with a single line `aws-code-deploy/deploy` once the orb has been invoked by adding the orbs stanza. For this example deployment can be as simple as:

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  aws-code-deploy: circleci/aws-code-deploy@0.0.11
workflows:
  deploy_application:
    jobs:
      - aws-code-deploy/deploy:
          application-name: myApplication
          deployment-group: myDeploymentGroup
          service-role-arn: myDeploymentGroupRoleARN
          bundle-bucket: myApplicationS3Bucket
          bundle-key: myS3BucketKey
```

Under the hood, this orb creates, bundles and deploys your application using your specified parameters set under the `aws-code-deploy/deploy` job declaration.

=== A Simple Example Using Heroku

Below is a simple example of deploying a Rails application to Heroku. The full application can be found in the https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-workflows/tree/sequential-branch-filter[Sequential Job branch of the CircleCI Demo Workflows repository]. The configuration uses https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/[workflows] to deploy only if the `sequential-branch-filter` branch is checked out and the `build` job has run. If your deploy job uses any output from previous jobs, you can share that data by https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#using-workspaces-to-share-data-among-jobs[using workspaces]. For more information on conditional deploys, see https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#using-contexts-and-filtering-in-your-workflows[Using Contexts and Filtering in your Workflows].

```yaml
version: 2.0

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.4-node
      - image: circleci/postgres:9.4.12-alpine
    working_directory: ~/circleci-demo-workflows
    steps:
      - checkout
      # Bundle install dependencies
      - run: bundle install --path vendor/bundle

      # Database setup
      - run: bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load

      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: rake

  deploy:
    machine:
        enabled: true
    working_directory: ~/circleci-demo-workflows
    environment:
      HEROKU_APP: "sleepy-refuge-55486"
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Setup Heroku
          command: bash .circleci/setup-heroku.sh

      - run:
          command: |
            git push heroku sequential-branch-filter:master
            heroku run rake db:migrate
            sleep 5 # sleep for 5 seconds to wait for dynos
            heroku restart
workflows:
  version: 2
  build-and-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - build
          filters:
            branches:
              only: sequential-branch-filter
```

Below is the same Heroku Deployment example but using the Heroku orb to simplify the configuration:

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  heroku: circleci/heroku@0.0.10. # Invoke the Heroku orb
workflows:
  heroku_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - heroku/deploy-via-git: # Use the pre-built deploy-via-git job
          requires:
            - build
          filters:
            branches:
              only: sequential-branch-filter
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.4-node
      - image: circleci/postgres:9.4.12-alpine
    working_directory: ~/circleci-demo-workflows
    steps:
      - checkout
      # Bundle install dependencies
      - run: bundle install --path vendor/bundle
      # Database setup
      - run: bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: rake
```
