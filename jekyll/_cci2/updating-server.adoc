== Org Rename Script

WARNING: Before updating please read and follow the steps below if you have **ever had issues with renaming an organization within CircleCI**
or you suspect that an **organization rename might have happened at any point**.

. SSH into your Services machine
. REPL into `workflows-conductor` by running the following: `sudo docker exec -it workflows-conductor lein repl :connect 6005`
. Copy/paste this script into the REPL session. It will run migration and output current progress.

== Update Steps Overview

Following is an overview of the CircleCI Server update steps. Each stage is described in detail below.

* Take a snapshot of your installation so you can rollback later if necessary (optional but recommended)
* Update Replicated and check you are running Docker v17.12.1, update if necessary
* Install the latest version of CircleCI Server

=== 1. Snapshot for Rollback

To take a snapshot of your installation:

. Go to the Management Console (e.g. `your-circleci-hostname.com:8800`) and click Stop Now to stop the CircleCI service.
+
.Stop CircleCI
image::stop_replicated.png[Stop CircleCI]
. Ensure no jobs are running on the nomad clients – you can check this by running `nomad status`
. Navigate to the AWS EC2 management console and select your Services machine instance
. Select Actions > Image > Create Image – Select the No Reboot option if you want to avoid downtime at this point. This image creation step creates an AMI that can be readily launched as a new EC2 instance to restore your installation.
+
.Snapshot Image Creation
image::create_snapshot.png[Snapshot Image Creation]

NOTE: It is also possible to automate this process with the AWS API. Subsequent AMIs/snapshots are only as large as the difference (changed blocks) since the last snapshot, such that storage costs are not necessarily larger for more frequent snapshots, see Amazon's EBS snapshot billing document for details.
Once you have the snapshot you are free to make changes on the Services machine.

If you do need to rollback at any point, see our https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/backup/#restoring-from-backup[guide to restoring from a backup].

=== 2. Updating Replicated

==== Prerequisites

* Your installation is Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04 based
* You are running replicated version >=2.10.3 on your services machine. Check by running the following:
+
```shell
replicated --version
```
// do they need to SSH into the services machine and run this? Actually we need to point them to what to do if their version of Replicated is pre 2.10.3 here
* Your installation is **not** airgapped and you can access the internet from it

==== Preparations

CAUTION: Remember to take a snapshot (described above) before starting the Replicated update process

. Stop the CircleCI application:
+
```shell
replicatedctl app stop
```
+
Application shutdown takes a few minutes. Please check the administration dashboard and wait for the status to become “Stopped” before continuing. You can also run the following command to view the app status:
// is this what we want them to do generally? In the step above we're saying to stop replicated from the dashboard
+
```shell
replicatedctl app status inspect
```
+
Example Output:
+
```shell
[
    {
        "AppID": "edd9471be0bc4ea04dfca94718ddf621",
        "Sequence": 2439,
        "State": "stopped",
        "DesiredState": "stopped",
        "Error": "",
        "IsCancellable": false,
        "IsTransitioning": false,
        "LastModifiedAt": "2018-10-23T22:00:21.314987894Z"
    }
]
```

. For the replicated update to succeed, it is necessary to update docker to the recommended version, 17.12.1:
// should there be a step to check Docker version first?
+
```shell
sudo apt-get install docker-ce=17.12.1~ce-0~ubuntu
```

. Pin the Docker version using the following command:
+
```shell
sudo apt-mark hold docker-ce
```

==== Perform Update

. Perform the Replicated update by executing the update script as follows:
+
```shell
curl -sSL "https://get.replicated.com/docker?replicated_tag=2.34.1" | sudo bash
```
+
Double-check your replicated and docker versions:
+
```shell
replicatedctl version    # 2.34.1
docker -v                # 17.12.1
```

. Restart the app with
+
```shell
replicatedctl app start
```
+
The application will take a few minutes to spin up. You can check the progress in the administration dashboard or by executing;
+
```shell
replicatedctl app status inspect
```
+
Example output:
+
```shell
[
    {
        "AppID": "edd9471be0bc4ea04dfca94718ddf621",
        "Sequence": 2439,
        "State": "started",
        "DesiredState": "started",
        "Error": "",
        "IsCancellable": true,
        "IsTransitioning": true,
        "LastModifiedAt": "2018-10-23T22:04:05.00374451Z"
    }
]
```

=== 3. Update CircleCI Server Version

. Once you are running the latest version of Replicated, click the View Update button in the Management Console dashboard.
// insert image when I have it
. Click Install next to the version you wish to install.
// insert image when I have it
+
The install process may take several minutes, and the install status will be displayed both on the Releases page and the main Dashboard.
. Once the installation is finished, navigate to the Dashboard to start your installation - Note the middle box on the Dashboard will read "CircleCI is up to date" when you are running the latest version.
