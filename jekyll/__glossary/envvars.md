term: Environment Variables
---

Environment variables store customer data that is used to set variables for a project. Only project Administrators and Owners are allowed to view or modify Environment Variables. The values are transmitted using secure protocols such as HTTPS and SSH, encrypted at rest and hashed/salted in a manner that prevents CircleCI employees from viewing them.
