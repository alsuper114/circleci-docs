term: Context

Contexts provide a mechanism for securing and sharing environment variables across projects. The environment variables are defined as name/value pairs and are injected at runtime. To use environment variables set on the Contexts page, the user running the workflow must be a member of the organization for which the context is set and the rule must allow access to all projects in the org. See the [Contexts]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/contexts/) document for instructions.
